# Superstore-Sales-Analysis-Dashboard
In a highly competitive retail landscape, understanding what drives profitability is key to growth. This Power BI project delivers a comprehensive sales performance analysis for a fictional Superstore, helping uncover what works, what doesn’t, and where to focus next.

By transforming raw transactional data into actionable insights, the dashboard empowers decision-makers to:

    - Identify top-performing products and regions
    
    - Uncover loss-making categories and customer segments
    
    - Understand the impact of discounts on profit
    
    - Track performance trends using Month-over-Month (MoM) and Year-over-Year (YoY) metrics

This analysis supports strategic decisions on product focus, regional investment, and discount optimization—enabling the business to reduce losses, improve margins, and align with customer demand.
